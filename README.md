# Unofficial LuUuMix-Radio.fm Plugin For XBMC

This is a very, very basic plugin for XBMC that allows you to listen to live streams from LuUuMix-Radio.fm.  

it's been tested under Mac OSX & on Win7.

## Installation Instructions

Simply download the latest zip file from the [downloads](downloads/) page.  On XBMC, go to System->Addons->Install from zip file & locate your downloaded zip file.

You can alternatively clone this repository & run the even more basic build script (by typing `sh build.sh` on a terminal) to generate the zip package, if you know what that means & have a UNIX compatible environment.
